I tested and ran this on an ubuntu machine with gcc version 11.4.0 (Ubuntu 11.4.0-1ubuntu1~22.04).
I do not know how it will compile (or not) on other Operating systems.


1. install g++ https://gcc.gnu.org/
2. call make
4. ./main
5. call make test
7. ./test matrix transform point-cloud triangles
8. call make performance
10. ./performance

If make does not work, the executables should work in an ubuntu environment when executed within the PROGRAMS folder
